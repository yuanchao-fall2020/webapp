# webapp

This web application is programmed by golang. I use Gin framework and Gorm to build the web app.
Prerequisites for building and deploying your application locally are goland, mysql and postman.
Before building and deploying, first, you should change the password in /dao/mysql.go. And then, you can create a DB named "DB1" in mysql.
In the end, you can type in "go run main.go" in terminal. And see the results in postman.
